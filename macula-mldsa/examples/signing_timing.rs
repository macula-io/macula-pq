//! Timing measurement for ML-DSA signing, dudect-style, against what FIPS
//! 204 permits signing's time to depend on.
//!
//! Run with `scripts/timing.sh` (release build; timing in a debug build
//! measures a different binary from the one that ships).
//!
//! ML-DSA-87, the set macula's identities use, and ML-DSA-65, the one set
//! with `eta = 4` and so its own packing and sampling. ML-DSA-44 shares
//! ML-DSA-87's `eta` and every code path, and is not timed.
//!
//! # What signing's time may depend on
//!
//! FIPS 204 signing loops until an attempt passes its checks, so its time
//! varies with the NUMBER OF ATTEMPTS, and the standard permits that: the
//! count depends on the secret only through whether a candidate would
//! leak it. Within one attempt, ExpandA rejection-samples from the public
//! `rho` and SampleInBall from the commitment hash `c~`, which the
//! signature publishes. Those are allowed to vary too. Nothing else is.
//!
//! So both classes here share every one of those inputs: the same `rho`,
//! `K`, `tr`, `mu` and `rnd`, which fix `A`, the mask `y`, `w`, `c~` and the
//! challenge, and every input is chosen to sign in exactly ONE attempt.
//! The classes differ only in the secret polynomials `s1`, `s2` and `t0`:
//! class A one fixed set, class B fresh realistic ones from key
//! generation. What is left to differ in time is the arithmetic on the
//! secret, which is exactly what must not.
//!
//! # Method
//!
//! As in macula-mlkem's harness: inputs are timed in pairs, one of each
//! class back to back in random order, and a t-test on the paired
//! differences asks whether one class is slower. It is repeated on pairs
//! cropped at several percentiles and the largest |t| is reported; above
//! 4.5 is a leak detected with high confidence. Pairing cancels the clock
//! drift a whole signature's duration would otherwise drown a leak in.
//! Every input is copied into one staging buffer before its clock starts,
//! so both classes are read from the same address.
//!
//! ⚠ A result below the threshold means NO LEAK WAS DETECTED at that
//! number of measurements, on this machine, with this compiler. It does
//! not prove the code constant-time.
//!
//! # Controls
//!
//! POSITIVE: signing followed by a branch on each byte of the packed
//! secret polynomials, taken for about 3% of them, about as often as a
//! hint bit is set. With class A's fixed bytes the branch predictor partly
//! learns the pattern; with class B's fresh ones it mispredicts. That is
//! the shape, and roughly the size, of the one difference this harness
//! found in its first runs: HintBitPack branched on each hint bit (see
//! below). An early-exit `==` on the key was tried first and was not
//! flagged at 4,000 measurements while the real hint branch was, so it
//! calibrated nothing. If this control is not flagged, the other results
//! mean nothing and the run exits 2.
//!
//! NEGATIVE: both classes sign with the SAME key bytes, class B's produced
//! by re-running key generation from class A's seed. If identical data is
//! flagged, a flag elsewhere may be how inputs were prepared, not what they
//! contain, and the run exits 3.
//!
//! # What the first runs found
//!
//! HintBitPack skipped its write for each zero hint bit. The hint depends
//! on the secret key, so fixed-versus-random secrets differed by about
//! 200 ns. At 40,000 measurements the branching version is flagged at
//! |t| 9.73 (ML-DSA-87) and 15.15 (ML-DSA-65); the branch-free one that
//! replaced it measures 1.48 and 0.90. The hint is published in the
//! signature, so this revealed nothing the signature does not, but it
//! would hide a real leak of the same size behind a permitted one.
