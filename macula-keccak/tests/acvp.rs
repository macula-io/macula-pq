//! Byte-exact against NIST's own ACVP vectors, vendored under `vectors/`.
//!
//! ⚠ WHY TWO VECTOR REVISIONS ARE USED, stated per function because the
//! two SHAKE directories do NOT behave the same and an earlier reading of
//! this generalised from one to both.
//!
//! - `SHAKE-128-FIPS202`: `outLen` 32 to 64 bytes against a 168-byte
//!   rate, so **every test fits inside the first squeezed block and NONE
//!   exercises a multi-block squeeze**. For SHAKE128 the multi-block
//!   coverage exists only in `SHAKE-128-1.0`'s VOT group: 37 runnable
//!   cases exceed the rate.
//! - `SHAKE-256-FIPS202`: `outLen` 16 to 512 bytes against a 136-byte
//!   rate, so it **does** carry multi-block cases, 25 of them.
//!
//! Multi-block squeezing is the sponge-state-across-calls path: where an
//! XOF goes wrong, and what ML-KEM leans on hardest when it expands its
//! matrix. `multi_block_coverage_exists_for_both_functions` asserts the
//! counts above rather than trusting this comment.
//!
//! ⚠ TWO DELIBERATE EXCLUSIONS, BOTH ASSERTED RATHER THAN ASSUMED.
//!
//! **Bit-oriented tests.** Most of the `-2.0` and `-1.0` vectors have
//! message lengths that are not multiples of 8: 1043 of 1194 for
//! SHA3-256, and 1218 of 1904 for SHAKE-128. This crate hashes BYTES,
//! because ML-KEM only ever hashes whole bytes, so those cases are not
//! runnable here and are skipped by `len % 8`. The counts below are
//! asserted so the skip stays bounded and visible: if a vector file
//! changes shape, the count changes and a test fails.
//!
//! ⚠ This corrects an earlier reading of these directories. The sets
//! named `-FIPS202` are 100% byte-aligned and are the ones a
//! byte-oriented implementation can run in full. The `-1.0` sets are not
//! simply "more coverage": they are a different ORIENTATION, of which the
//! byte-aligned subset is what remains. They are still the only source of
//! multi-block squeeze coverage, which is why both are used.
//!
//! **LDT groups**: 8 GiB per test, four tests. Not a unit test.
//! **MCT groups**: chained, handled separately, and their expected
//! results are a `resultsArray` rather than an `md`.
