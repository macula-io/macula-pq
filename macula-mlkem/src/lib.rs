//! ML-KEM (FIPS 203), implemented here rather than depended on.
//!
//! **Built on `macula-keccak`, deliberately.** FIPS 203 is built on
//! SHA3-256, SHA3-512, SHAKE128 and SHAKE256, so implementing ML-KEM while
//! taking Keccak from a third party would relocate the dependency rather
//! than remove it.
//!
//! # API
//!
//! - [`key_gen`] and [`encaps`]: FIPS 203 Algorithms 19 and 20. Their
//!   seeds are drawn from the OS, and if it cannot supply them the result
//!   is [`Error::RandomnessUnavailable`], as those algorithms require.
//! - [`decaps`]: Algorithm 18, with implicit rejection. A ciphertext that
//!   does not re-encrypt yields a pseudorandom secret, not an error.
//! - [`encaps_key_valid`] and [`decaps_key_valid`]: the section 7.2 and
//!   7.3 input checks.
//!
//! # Randomness comes from the OS, and nothing else
//!
//! Not `aws-lc-rs`, and not ours: a hand-written CSPRNG is the one piece of
//! this workspace where rolling your own would be unambiguously wrong,
//! because randomness has no test vectors. You cannot test that output is
//! unpredictable, so it is the one place a bug would be invisible to the
//! method everything else here relies on.
//!
//! # Wiping secrets
//!
//! Every secret is wiped when it is dropped, using the `zeroize` crate:
//! seeds, the secret key, noise polynomials, the message, shared secrets,
//! and the values decryption derives from them. What a caller receives
//! that is secret comes as [`Zeroizing`], which wipes itself too: the
//! decapsulation key and the shared secret. Every buffer holding a secret
//! is allocated at its final size, because a buffer that grows leaves a
//! copy of its old contents behind.
//!
//! **The heap is measured**: `tests/heap_residue.rs` scans every block
//! freed during key generation, encapsulation and both kinds of
//! decapsulation for that run's secrets, and finds none. **The stack is
//! wiped by construction**, which safe code cannot observe, and copies the
//! compiler makes when it moves or spills a value are beyond any of it, as
//! `zeroize` itself states.
//!
//! # The `internal` feature
//!
//! Key generation and encapsulation with caller-supplied seeds (FIPS 203
//! Algorithms 16 and 17), and the arithmetic, are public only with the
//! `internal` feature, and it is for testing. FIPS 203 sections 3.3 and 6
//! say those interfaces "should not be made available to applications
//! other than for testing purposes": whoever chooses `m` knows the shared
//! secret. They exist because NIST's vectors supply `d`, `z` and `m`
//! directly, which is what makes byte-exact verification possible at all.
//!
//! # Verification
//!
//! Byte-exact against NIST's ACVP vectors, at ML-KEM-512, -768 and -1024:
//! key generation, encapsulation, decapsulation and both key checks, 285
//! cases, with the fifteen implicit-rejection cases each identified by
//! NIST's own label (`tests/acvp.rs`; provenance in `vectors/README.md`).
//!
//! # Timing: measured, and what that means
//!
//! `scripts/timing.sh` times decapsulation and encapsulation in a release
//! build. Its verdict is only worth something because it is calibrated:
//! its positive control is a leak of the size the constant-time compare
//! exists to prevent, planted after a real decapsulation. A copy of
//! [`decaps`] with that compare replaced by `==` and a branch is flagged by
//! the valid-against-invalid test. A dudect-style harness testing the two
//! classes as independent samples did not flag that copy at 100,000
//! measurements; see `examples/timing.rs` for the method and the confounds
//! its negative control exposed. The latest result is in the workspace
//! README.
//!
//! **"No division on secret data" is asserted by construction, not
//! established by that harness**, which has never been calibrated against
//! a planted division. Compression multiplies and shifts, ByteDecode at
//! 12 bits subtracts under a mask, and compression is tested equal to the
//! division formula for every input. The only `/` and `%` left are
//! evaluated at compile time, or divide loop counters, bit indices and
//! public bytes by powers of two.

// `internal` feature, which is for testing: see `internal`'s docs.
