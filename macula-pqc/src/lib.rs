//! The facade: the one place macula's post-quantum posture is decided.
//!
//! # API
//!
//! [`client_builder`] and [`server_builder`]: rustls configuration
//! builders with the crypto provider and TLS 1.3 already fixed. The caller
//! chooses certificates, the verifier, client authentication and ALPN. It
//! cannot choose the key exchange groups or the signature algorithms.
//!
//! [`self_signed_certificate`]: a self-signed ML-DSA-87 certificate and
//! its PKCS#8 key from a 32-byte seed, the form a macula node keeps its
//! TLS key in.
//!
//! [`KeyPossessionVerifier`]: a server certificate verifier for such a
//! certificate, and the one a macula client dials a station with. It
//! accepts exactly one certificate whose key is ML-DSA-87, then the
//! server's handshake signature under that key. It proves the server holds
//! the key, not who the server is: the caller binds the key to an identity.
//!
//! # Getting started
//!
//! Depend on `macula-pqc` and nothing else for TLS. Build each rustls
//! configuration from one of the two builders, then carry on as with any
//! rustls builder: the key exchange groups and the signature algorithms
//! are the only things already decided.
//!
//! ```
//! # fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {

//!     .with_single_cert(vec![certificate], private_key.into())?;
//!
//! // Both offer SecP384r1MLKEM1024, then SecP256r1MLKEM768, and nothing

//! ```
//!
//! For QUIC, hand the result to quinn as usual, for example
//! `quinn::crypto::rustls::QuicClientConfig::try_from(client)`. QUIC
//! requires TLS 1.3, which both builders already fix.
//!
//! # Why a facade, and why the posture lives here
//!
//! The `kx_groups` list IS the post-quantum posture: which groups are
//! offered, in what order, and that nothing classical-only is among them.
//! That is policy, not QUIC plumbing, so it does not belong in a QUIC
//! transport crate.
//!
//! `macula_quic` and `macula-rust` each used to select a crypto provider
//! themselves. Two copies of one posture is a contract in two places: one
//! of them eventually gains a classical fallback and nothing notices. Both
//! now build their TLS configurations from here, on their default
//! branches.
//!
//! # ⚠ How far "locked" goes, stated precisely
//!
//! - **What is locked:** no function here returns a `CryptoProvider`. The
//!   provider goes straight into a rustls builder, which keeps it in a
//!   private field and offers only a read-only view (`crypto_provider()`),
//!   and so does every configuration built from it. Nothing a caller
//!   receives lets it add or remove a group, and the groups themselves are
//!   not re-exported.
//! - **What is not, and cannot be:** rustls is a public crate. A caller
//!   that depends on it directly can build a configuration from scratch
//!   with any provider, or clone ours out of the read-only view and build
//!   a new one. Both bypass this crate entirely: a deliberate act, visible
//!   in review, not an edit to something this crate handed out. Nothing in
//!   Rust can prevent that, and claiming otherwise would be the same
//!   defect as a guard that cannot fire.
//!
//! So the guarantee is: **every configuration built from this crate offers
//! exactly our list**, and the tests beside the list assert that of the
//! builders themselves, including the negative control that makes the
//! posture checkable rather than merely documented.
